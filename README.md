# About

Dependency Frost is an educational platformer game originally built with the JavaScript gaming framework Kaboom [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com) to promote awareness of security in open source dependencies. Kaboom is no longer maintained, and the game has now been migrated to [kaplay](https://kaplayjs.com/)

Can you escape all the vulnerable npm packages?
