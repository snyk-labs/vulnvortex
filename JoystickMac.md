This brings up the mapping interface. You can name the preset and `scan` for joystick movement or button press from here. 

Add mappings by choosing `scan` on the left, moving the joystick or pressing the button and then choosing a keyboard key on the right.

For this game, you only need to map left and right on the joystick to the left and right arrow keys and map the first two buttons to the space bar.

### Testing

Pressing either of the left most buttons on the `Arcade Stick` should start the game.

While in the game, you can move the joystick left and right to move Patch left and right. And, pressing either of the buttons should make Patch jump.

If you get hit by a vuln, you can restart the game by pressing either of the buttons again.
